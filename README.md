# Game-Management-System
## Topic
The game management platform offers a marketplace for users and developers to buy and sell complete games or game codes, along with features to browse games, manage user profiles, and friend lists.
## Problem 
The current market lacks a platform that bridges the gap between Steam and itch.io. Steam allows users to buy games but doesnâ€™t support developers in buying or selling game code. Itch.io is developer-friendly but less accessible for regular users. This creates challenges for both developers and users seeking a more seamless experience in buying and selling games and game codes. My platform aims to solve this by providing a marketplace that is intuitive for both developers and regular users.
## Proposed system
Our platform provides a user-friendly marketplace where both developers and regular users can easily buy and sell complete games or game codes. It combines the accessibility of Steam with the flexibility of itch.io, allowing developers to showcase their work while offering an intuitive experience for users. The platform also features game browsing, user profile management, and friend list capabilities. By offering tools for both developers and users, it aims to streamline the buying and selling process for both complete games and game codes.

## Non-functional requirements (NFRs)
Performance: The system should allow users to browse their game and code libraries with a response time of no more than 2 seconds for each query.
Scalability: The system should handle up to 1 million games and source code entries in the library and market databases.
Maintainability: Error messages should be clear and provide guidance for corrective actions.
